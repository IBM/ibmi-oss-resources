## Case Studies

| Company (link) | Synopsis      | Quote         |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [CRAS](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/cras-systems-open-source) | Deployed Node-RED to integrate with PLC IoT devices | *"The ability to run the latest open source software alongside unmodified code from the 1980s is surely unheard of on any other platform, and this offers huge value to our business in terms of reducing both ongoing risk and costs in IT."* |
| [Deknudt Frames](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/deknudt-frames) | Using open source to revitalize its e-commerce platform | *"what’s really interesting is that this up-to-date, open source solution runs side-by-side and fully integrated with trusted core business systems originally coded in the 1970s."* 
| [Fibrocrit](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/fibrocit-systems-furniture-design) | Using open source to modernize its project management and design processes | *"The fact that the platform supports open source solutions means that we can leverage the very best technology and benefit from the support and development of the open source community while avoiding inhibitive licensing costs."* |
| [Winsol](https://cms.ibm.com/case-studies/winsol-systems-hardware-manufacturing-digitization) | Replaced manufacturing-control terminals across its shop floor, connecting to new open source software | *"Everything – both core business systems and the new open source solutions – runs on IBM i, so reliability is perfect as always. And the faster processes have certainly made our lives easier."* |
| [Kube-Pak](https://cms.ibm.com/case-studies/kube-pak-systems-gardening-wholesale) | Integrating open source with battle-tested core business logic | *"We can develop in C, PHP, Java – there’s now a full range of open source software on the platform that meshes seamlessly with the core technologies that we’ve been running for decades"* ||
| [JORI](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/jori) | Built a 3D configurator using open source | *"What’s really cool is that this innovative, open-source solution is fully integrated with application code and business rules that our client has entrusted to i since the 1980s."* |
